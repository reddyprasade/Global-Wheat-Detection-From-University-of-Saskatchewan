Global WHEAT Dataset is the first large-scale dataset for wheat head detection from field optical images. It included a very large range of cultivars from differents continents. Wheat is a staple crop grown all over the world and consequently interest in wheat phenotyping spans the globe. Therefore, it is important that models developed for wheat phenotyping, such as wheat head detection networks, generalize between different growing environments around the world.

The Problem
------

For several years, agricultural research has been using sensors to observe plants at key moments in their development. However, some important plant traits are still measured manually. One example of this is the manual counting of wheat ears from digital images - a long and tedious job. Factors that make it difficult to manually count wheat ears from digital images include the possibility of overlapping ears, variations in appearance according to maturity and genotype, the presence or absence of barbs, head orientation and even wind.

The Need
-------
There is the need for a robust and accurate computer model that is capable of counting wheat ears from digital images. This model will benefit phenotyping research and help producers around the world assess ear density, health and maturity more effectively. Some work has already been done in deep learning, though it has resulted in too little data to have a generic model.

The Competition
--------

The Global Wheat Head Challenge, an international data science competition, was created to address this need. The objective is to have a software model capable of locating ears on a wide variety of data, without bias. Data Scientists, hackers, scientists and the curious re invited to join forces with us to solve this challenge!

The competition will run on the Kaggle platform from May 4 to August 4 2020.
International consortium, Global Wheat Dataset, has made more than 190,000 wheat ears available for this competition. Participants are invited to submit software models, based on this dataset, for counting wheat ears effectively.
